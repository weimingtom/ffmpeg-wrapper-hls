This is fork of https://github.com/hyperoslo/ffmpeg-wrapper

=====================================

FFMPEG is one of the most popular video/image processing library. Not only is it optimized for x86, but also for arm and
mips. Therefore not only does it run on powerful enterprise x86 servers, but also arm/mips based smartphone/tablets,
both iOS and Android.

This project mainly focus on Android platform.

=====================================
 What makes this project different
=====================================
1. Works as a library, not a single process. There are quite a few of ffmpeg-for-android open source projects in github,
those project uses ffmpeg as an independent process. 

2. Change the source code as little as possible. FFMPEG is a very dynamic project, which is upgraded very often. I want
to make sure the changes are very few, so that when it upgrades, I don't need to change too much.


=====================================
 What was changed
=====================================
1. main() -> __main()

2. hook log_infrastrucutre to Android's

3. exit() -> longjmp()
For an Linux app, 'exit on error' is a good enough approach, but not for a library - it would crash the whole process.
So all the exit is changed to longjmp back to Java layer
